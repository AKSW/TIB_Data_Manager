# Plugins

There are also plugins still in here which are not used anymore. They will be removed in the future.

## dataretrieval

This will be replaced because a federated search will be implemented which will shift the mapping process to the data repositories.

## dcat

Enhance the harvester to be also able to harvest DCAT endpoints and does provide one itself.

## discovery

Adds GUI elements: tag cloud, similar datasets and search suggestions.

## harvest

Adds the harvest functionality which is able to harvest APIs of other CKAN instances.
Harvests have to be started manually and could be configured/programmed.

## streamtheme
